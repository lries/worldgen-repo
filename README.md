# worldgen-repo
World-generating code. I'll probably not finish this any time soon, but it works reasonably well as-is. WorldGenTopo is the finished portion, and running it will generate image files representing a world. This is Java code and has no external dependencies. The commenting needs work; if something is confusing tell me and I'll fix it. Society generation is very iffy and is provided on an as-is basis; I might fix it later or I might not. 

If the GNU license is too restrictive and you want to use it for something in which you'd like a less restrictive license for some reason, drop me a line at riesx109@umn.edu and we'll work something out - this is hardly the most unique program in the world.
